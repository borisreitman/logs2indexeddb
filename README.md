logs2indexeddb
==============

Utility that saves all javascript console logs into the IndexedDB database.
You can access console.* logs after the browser tab was closed.
This utility is a good choise for developers that need to analyze web client logs after a time.

==============
Version 0.0.1
The first version contains only a sample html page that tests IndexedDB database performance.
Next time I will commit ready to use utility that catches all you write to console.* methods and stores in local database. There will be methods that allow you to request console logs.
